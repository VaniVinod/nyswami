                    Maharaj Ji is a naishtik brahmachari (celibate since birth). It is a common saying “Morning shows the day”. Since his childhood his holiness exhibited Divine qualities of a saint and observed four regulative principles naturally. At the tender age of 9 years his holiness after seeing a movie “Dhruva Maharaj” left his home and proceeded towards the forest just to darshan of the Lord Krishna in person.
